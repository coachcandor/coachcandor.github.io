# ðŸš€ Minimum Viable Demo!

Building our minimum viable demo has been challenging! Building software part time is hard. With our core team working full-time jobs, weâ€™ve tackled this project over countless evenings, collaborating tirelessly to bring our vision to life. The technical backbone of our demo required significant work around integrating a large language model (LLM) with Microsoft Teams using the Graph API, which presented some challenging obstacles. Thankfully, Andyâ€™s expertise was invaluable hereâ€”his guidance helped us bridge the complex components seamlessly.

Meanwhile, Carl took on the challenge of visualizing data, experimenting with D3 to bring our results to life. His visualizations not only look fantastic but also enhance the user experience, making the data more accessible and engaging. Weâ€™re also grateful for Mark Wilkins, who recently joined us part-time, helping us focus on shaping this demo into a functional minimum viable product (MVP).

Weâ€™re proud of the demo weâ€™ve built and you can find a video of this on [our product page](https://coachcandor.com/product/). Feedback is crucial as we refine our solution, so please share any thoughts you have. Weâ€™re actively seeking organizations interested in trialing our platform for **free** â€” this will allow us to learn from real-world use and iterate effectively.
